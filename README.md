# the flush

a daily participation ritual built on solana.

## what this is
the flush is not a game.
it’s not a lottery.
it’s not gambling.

users connect a wallet holding $poope,
check in once per day,
and sometimes you get splashed.

## why this exists
crypto lost excitement by asking too much.
the flush asks almost nothing.

show up.
leave.
sometimes something happens.

## how it works
- connect a solana wallet
- wallet must hold $poope
- one daily check-in per 24h
- the flush happens separately
- winners are selected server-side
- rewards are assigned quietly

## status
shipping in public for the pump hackathon.

## disclaimer
entertainment only.
no promises.
no expectations.
